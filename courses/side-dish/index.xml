      <description>This recipe resulted in a flavorful braised beef. It&#39;s quite simple to make although it takes nearly 2 hours to cook. The recipe is from &#34;Culinária Portuguesa&#34;. As for the garlic and parsley butter, it&#39;s a family recipe and it&#39;s incredibly good. In potatoes, on top of a steak, it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s just good.Ingredients (6 servings)For the Braised Beef:
 1kg stewing beef  2 medium onions 2 red peppers  3 tomatoes  2 garlic cloves 1 bay leaf bunch fresh parsley 3dl (1 1/4 cups) white wine 1 tablespoon vinegar 1dl (1/3 cup) olive oil bacon, salt, pepper q.</description>

      <description>Pan Fried Steak is a Portuguese classic. I cook this at least once every other week and it never fails me. In Portugal, you can find this in almost every restaurant and it&#39;s usually accompanied by french fries, rice and a fried egg. This is my mum&#39;s recipe. As for the baked mashed potatoes, the recipe comes from Pantagruel and they were creamy with an added outside crunch.Ingredients (8-10 tarts)For the Steaks</description>

      <description>Today I&#39;ll share another recipe from Pantagruel. I&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s a Portuguese recipe, but it sounded good and I decided to give it a try. It was very tasty! And it worked out great with the Beef Stew that I shared last week.Ingredients (4 servings) 750g (26oz) finely sliced potatoes 150g (5oz) grated mozzarella 40g (1.5oz) grated parmesan 2 eggs 2 1/2dl (1 cup) milk butter, salt, pepper, nutmeg q.</description>

      <description>It was time to share with you the recipe that gave name to this blog. We don&#39;t eat this as often as we should for something so tasty, because we don&#39;t have &#34;easy&#34; access to salted cod fish here in Denmark. It&#39;s sad but true. And this potatoes just ask for it. I actually get that feeling that there&#39;s something missing. But it&amp;rsquo;s better to eat them this way than to not eat them at all.</description>

      <description>This is a very simple meal but very tasty. I sometimes make the turkey steaks during the week with broccoli or some other vegetable, but because today is Saturday let&#39;s load up on carbs! No source for the recipe. It&#39;s just one of those things that I have eaten all my life. My mum actually makes this rice for special occasions because it&#39;s incredibly tasty.Ingredients (2 servings)Turkey Steaks</description>
