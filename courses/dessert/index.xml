      <title>Apple Tarts</title>

      <description>So it has been a while! And here I am with probably the longest post so far. But for a very good reason: a new and improved puff pastry for tarts recipe (here is the old one) and some delicious apple tarts. The husband loves these tarts. We had some the last time we were in Portugal, which naturally prompted me to answer the question: can I make this at home?</description>

      <title>Easter Bread II</title>

      <description>I hope you&#39;re having a nice Easter. Last year I shared a recipe from &#34;Pantagruel&#34; for a traditional Portuguese Easter bread, but I completely failed its presentation. So this year I decided to try a new recipe and this time from &#34;Cozinha Tradicional Portuguesa&#34;. And I&#39;m glad I decided to give it a try because I actually prefer this version. The egg in the middle is completely optional. I&amp;rsquo;ve never in my life ate the boiled egg.</description>

      <description>Almond Tart is a staple at my grandparents for every party/celebration. The recipe that my aunts use is more of a cake than a tart. But I wanted to try something knew and as it turns out a tart base is just as good. This tart contains extraordinary amounts of butter and a crunchy top. It&amp;rsquo;s great on it&amp;rsquo;s own or even better when accompanied by some vanilla ice cream. The recipe is from Cozinha Tradicional Portuguesa.</description>

      <description>Valentine&#39;s Day is almost here and I just had to make something in the shape of an heart. Last year was breakfast, but this year I made cinnamon cookies. Last Christmas I got a classic Portuguese cookbook called &amp;ldquo;Cozinha Tradicional Portuguesa&amp;rdquo; by Maria de Lourdes Modesto. It has amazing detailed recipes from all over the country and it even has some pictures (as opposed to Pantagruel). This is the third recipe that I&amp;rsquo;ve tried from this book and it turned out even better than I was expecting.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve shared a recipe for bacalhau (salted and dried codfish), but no Portuguese Christmas dinner is complete without filhoses (or velhoses). Or at least this is true for Center Portugal. Filhoses can be made of pumpkin or of carrots. In my family however we only make carrot filhoses. Both my grandmothers use carrots and this is the recipe of one of them. They never really measured their ingredients, but this is a close approximation that an aunt of mine came up with, after watching my grandmother.</description>

      <description>I talked raisins and nuts last week and it wouldn&#39;t be right to skip cooking something with apples this autumn. Whenever I&#39;m out of ideas for new recipes I just pick &#34;Pantagruel&#34; and look for inspiration. This recipe seemed simple enough and, more importantly, the main focus was on apples. The recipe called for Reinetteapples. These apples originated in France and are oftentimes used as a cooking apples in Portugal. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find them in Denmark and so I used Royal Gala instead.</description>

      <description>Now this is a first. I couldn&#39;t find an appropriate title in English for this post so there you go, good old Portuguese. We don&#39;t really celebrate Halloween in Portugal. Instead, on the 1st of November, children wake up early in the morning and go door-to-door asking for Bolinho or Pão-por-Deus - basically they get treats that can be in the form of these rolls I&#39;m sharing today, chocolates, money or even walnuts/chestnuts if you&#39;re terribly unlucky.</description>

      <title>Portuguese Rice Pudding </title>

      <description>I keep introducing Portuguese recipes as &#34;classic&#34;/&#34;traditional&#34;, but lets face it, Portuguese Rice Pudding is a Portuguese classic. It&#39;s on our tables at birthday parties, Christmas and any other occasion. This one is my mom&#39;s recipe and is a very simple recipe. Some people use vanilla or even some sort of flan to give it a more structured texture, but I prefer this version. It&#39;s creamy and delicious. I hope you enjoy it.</description>

      <description>And now for a very simple but delicious cake. The cake&#39;s recipe is from an aunt of mine and I decided to spruce it up a bit with an orange glaze. &#34;Pantagruel&#34; has several recipes for glazes, and orange+carrot seemed a great combo. It was. On a side note, can you tell that the light in Denmark has already started to change? From now until April I guess I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to start prepping dinner at 2pm if I want to shoot with natural light.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s recipe is another Portuguese classic. It&#39;s my mum&#39;s recipe that my sister wrote down a few years ago (and good thing she did because my mother no longer has it). I have been wanting to try it for a long time, but I can&#39;t seem to find siam pumpkin jam in Denmark. So I brought a jar of jam with me from Portugal. This jam has a very distinctive savor and, although I wouldn&#39;t spread it on a slice of bread, when together with almonds and orange it has incredible flavor.</description>

      <description>So last week I was looking through my cookbooks trying to figure out what to bake the next day, when I came across these cookies. They were super simple to make. Delicate and delicious - the kind of cookies that melt in your mouth. And perfect to go with a cup of tea. This recipe is adapted from &#34;Culinária Portuguesa&#34;.Ingredients (10 cookie sandwiches) 60g (half stick) butter at room temperature 2 level tablespoons sugar  1 egg 100g (3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon) flour 2 teaspoons baking powder  raspberry jam q.</description>

      <description>Today I&#39;ll share my favorite dessert as a kid. Perhaps it still is, but now I have to make it. Twenty years ago, my mum came up with the idea and it soon became a classic at my parent&#39;s restaurant (no longer in existence). It is, quite simply, frozen cream enveloped in frozen chocolate mousse, surrounded by melted chocolate. The outside chocolate remains soft, in contrast with the firmer interior, in a perfect blend of texture and sweetness.</description>

      <description>Every since I can remember, all birthdays in my family are celebrated with this cake. There is no real reason not to make it for other occasions, but I can&#39;t help but feel that it is a birthday type of cake. It also helps that my birthday is in July and that I get to use really good strawberries. It&#39;s my favorite cake without a doubt. If you don&#39;t like wet cakes, skip the part where I use the juice of one orange.</description>

      <description>Last week I shared a traditional Portuguese main course Onion sauce steaks, but today I will share a classic dessert. You can literally find this in every Portuguese restaurant in Leiria (small town in central Portugal), and one can probably say the same for the remainder of Portugal. It&#39;s simple to make, refreshing and it has incredible flavor. For me the most difficult part is making the caramel due to my irrational fear of getting burned.</description>

      <description>This was a first and it was mouthwatering. The cake recipe is from &#34;Culinária Portuguesa&#34; and the frosting is from Pantagruel. I added the almonds because I simply love the combo chocolate + roasted almonds. The cake was fluffy and the frosting remained shinny until the end. As for the taste, it had just the right amount of chocolate. Not too sweet.Ingredients (12 servings)For the cake

      <description>Now for part II of the Portuguese Egg Tarts. As I mentioned before, I used store-bought puff pastry when I tried the egg tarts recipe for the first time. I promised a recipe for puff pastry and here it is. But I have to say that I was a little disappointed with the result. I was excepting it to be great but the texture wasn&#39;t 100% right. The flavor however surpassed the store-bought puff pastry without a doubt.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been wanting to try a Pastel de Nata recipe for years now. Pantagruel has two recipes, I tried them both and they were kind of bad... The taste was o.k. but the texture was nothing like the real deal. Who knows, maybe in the old days that&#39;s how they did it. Then I remembered that a aunt of mine used to bring a Portuguese egg tart (a whole tart) to my grandparents and thought that it might be worth a try.</description>

      <description>And now for another surprisingly good cookies that include olive oil in the recipe (like the Algarve&#39;s Honey Cake). The husband wanted to take some cookies with him to a competition and I usually bake lemon cookies and something else. These were a perfect addition. The recipe is from Pantagruel and it included an alcoholic Portuguese beverage called Aguardentewhich I didn&#39;t include because I don&#39;t like desserts with alcohol. But if you do, just add 9 tablespoons (or 1 cálice if you have any idea what I&#39;m talking about).</description>

      <description>I started using this recipe while I was still in college because it was so simple and also because it was a big crowd pleaser. The original recipe included fresh cheese but I have never tried it that way. I&#39;ve made so many changes to the recipe that I consider this my recipe for a no-bake cheesecake. You can use other kinds of jam. I know from experience that with mixed berry jam is just as good.</description>

      <description>The first time I visited Denmark, I tried their Cinnamon Rolls from some bakery and I have to say that I wasn&#39;t impressed. I also tried the store bought ones and although I liked them better, I got the feeling that I hadn&#39;t tried the real deal yet. So, when I saw that Aarstiderne had released their recipe on their Facebook page I couldn&#39;t resist giving it a try (Aarstiderne supplies organically produced fruit and vegetables door to door).</description>

      <description>Chocolate Salami is another classic Portuguese recipe. I wouldn&#39;t say that it is historically old, but while growing up in Portugal you would find it most kids parties. You can also find it supermarkets and coffee shops, but nothing beats the homemade version. It requires no cooking and you can assemble everything in less than half an hour - or even faster if you have a food processor. This recipe is from Pantagruel.</description>

      <description>An orange roll has very few ingredients and no flour at all. It might sound strange but this specific kind of roll doesn&#39;t need it. There are a lot of different kinds of rolls and it is a rather common dessert in Portugal. It is fresh and light. This is my mum&#39;s recipe which I think is better than the one from Pantagruel (the only difference is in the quantity used).</description>

      <description>Continuing with the Easter topic, here is a recipe for a traditional Easter bread called *&#34;Folar&#34;*, from Pantagruel. The presentation doesn&#39;t exactly match what you would find in Portugal, but the taste sure does. The traditional presentation includes a baked egg in the middle of the bread (that we actually don&#39;t like). And I happened to forgot to brush the bread with egg yolk. :)Ingredients (2 loaves) 475g (4 cups) flour 190g (6.</description>

      <description>I looked at this recipe several times before deciding that it might be a good one. The fact that it includes olive oil on the ingredients list threw me off at first, but my curiosity got the better of me and I am grateful for it. It was an exceptional good cake with a lot of flavor and a very soft texture. Yes, it asks for a lot of honey, but in the end it was just the right amount.</description>

      <description>White Bean Tarts are a traditional pastry from central Portugal (where I happen to come from). But you can find this tarts all over the country (Lisbon&#39;s airport included). They&#39;re extremely sweet and taste nothing like beans. They work great for a party or to accompany an espresso for your mid-afternoon snack. This was the first time I used this recipe and it worked out great. Ingredients (12 tarts) 500g (2 1/2 cups) caster sugar 300g (10.</description>

      <description>Today I&#39;ll share my mum&#39;s recipe for Camel&#39;s Dribble. Don&#39;t let the title scare you. Camel&#39;s Dribble is basically caramel mousse. It&#39;s extremely sweet and has a very intense flavor. Sweeter than Chocolate Mousse for instance. Consider yourself warned - if you like sweets, there&#39;s something delicious on your way.Ingredients (10 servings) 1 can of cooked or uncooked sweet condensed milk 5 eggs  Instructions (Time: 3-6 hours)If you can find cooked sweet condensed milk in your supermarket then you can skip this step, otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll need to boil your uncooked can.</description>

      <description>I mentioned on a post about the chocolate mousse that I know three dessert recipes by heart. I&#39;ve shared the pancake recipe, the chocolate mousse and now it&#39;s time for the Sponge Cake. This time I decided to make an Orange Sponge Cake, but you can use the zest of a lemon instead of a zest of an orange. In my family, we make this cake regularly for guests or to take with us to my grandparents.</description>

      <description>These chocolate bonbons aren&#39;t really portuguese. More like brazilian. But they are quite common in Portugal and are amazing. They have a very intense flavor and gooey texture. This was the first time that I made this in Denmark because, until now, I wasn&#39;t able to find sweet condensed milk in the supermarket. But the other day there it was on the baking supplies&#39; aisle. :) It&#39;s another recipe from Pantagruel!</description>

      <description>And here is another recipe from Pantagruel. This was the first time that I tried this recipe and it did not disappoint. I will definitely make this chocolate cake again, but I will change the baking time for the next time I use this one. The recipe asked for 45-50 minutes in the oven and after 30 minutes I checked it with a toothpick and it was done! Ingredients (12 servings) 225g flour (1 cup) (+ a bit for the cake pan) 150g granulated sugar (3/4 cup) 130g butter at room temperature (4.</description>

      <description>While growing up Chocolate Mousse was a staple at my parents house in every special occasion. Christmas, Easter, birthdays, you name it and Chocolate Mousse was there. It&#39;s one of the three recipes that I know by heart: chocolate mousse, pancakes and sponge cake. It requires patience with the egg whites, but other than that there is really not much to it.Ingredients (6-8 servings) 6 eggs 6 tablespoons of granulated sugar 200g of good dark chocolate (7oz) 1 tablespoon of butter  Instructions (Time: 4 hours)Start by melting the chocolate with the butter in a double boiler.</description>

      <description>Desserts are my favorite things to cook. This recipe has turned out a great success every time I used it. It takes some time to finish but in the end is totally worth it. The husband loves these cookies. They keep well and make a great combo with coffee or tea. And it&#39;s another recipe from Pantagruel!Ingredients (30 cookies) 1/2kg white flour (4 cups) 200g granulated sugar (7oz) 250g butter at room temperature (9oz) 2 eggs 1 small lemon  Instructions (Time: 2 hours)Start by beating the eggs with the sugar and the zest of the lemon.</description>
