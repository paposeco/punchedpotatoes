      <description>This is a very simple meal but very tasty. I sometimes make the turkey steaks during the week with broccoli or some other vegetable, but because today is Saturday let&#39;s load up on carbs! No source for the recipe. It&#39;s just one of those things that I have eaten all my life. My mum actually makes this rice for special occasions because it&#39;s incredibly tasty.Ingredients (2 servings)Turkey Steaks</description>
