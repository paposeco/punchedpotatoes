      <description>I grew up eating pork carré occasionally and was truly surprised when I found this meat cut here in Denmark, even though carré doesn&#39;t sound Portuguese at all. And with a recognizable name! (Svine carré). I made some changes to a recipe from Culinária Portuguese and it worked perfectly. It is a moist pork roast and I think the fat on top helps to give it flavor. This recipe followed a series of mishaps in the last month, so I was more than happy with how wonderful this roast turned out.</description>

      <description>So last week I was looking through my cookbooks trying to figure out what to bake the next day, when I came across these cookies. They were super simple to make. Delicate and delicious - the kind of cookies that melt in your mouth. And perfect to go with a cup of tea. This recipe is adapted from &#34;Culinária Portuguesa&#34;.Ingredients (10 cookie sandwiches) 60g (half stick) butter at room temperature 2 level tablespoons sugar  1 egg 100g (3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon) flour 2 teaspoons baking powder  raspberry jam q.</description>

      <description>This recipe resulted in a flavorful braised beef. It&#39;s quite simple to make although it takes nearly 2 hours to cook. The recipe is from &#34;Culinária Portuguesa&#34;. As for the garlic and parsley butter, it&#39;s a family recipe and it&#39;s incredibly good. In potatoes, on top of a steak, it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s just good.Ingredients (6 servings)For the Braised Beef:
 1kg stewing beef  2 medium onions 2 red peppers  3 tomatoes  2 garlic cloves 1 bay leaf bunch fresh parsley 3dl (1 1/4 cups) white wine 1 tablespoon vinegar 1dl (1/3 cup) olive oil bacon, salt, pepper q.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s recipe is another Portuguese classic. We call it Bifes de Cebolada and you can probably find it in any traditional Portuguese restaurant. I used a recipe from Culinária Portuguesa. This was the first time that I made it in Denmark because until now, I couldn&#39;t seem to find steaks with the right thickness. I didn&#39;t think twice when I actually found them. The sweetness of the onions brings out your gluttonous self and you just can&#39;t stop eating.</description>

      <description>This was a first and it was mouthwatering. The cake recipe is from &#34;Culinária Portuguesa&#34; and the frosting is from Pantagruel. I added the almonds because I simply love the combo chocolate + roasted almonds. The cake was fluffy and the frosting remained shinny until the end. As for the taste, it had just the right amount of chocolate. Not too sweet.Ingredients (12 servings)For the cake
 125g (1 stick) cold butter 125g (1 cup) powdered sugar 125g (4.</description>

      <description>Now for part II of the Portuguese Egg Tarts. As I mentioned before, I used store-bought puff pastry when I tried the egg tarts recipe for the first time. I promised a recipe for puff pastry and here it is. But I have to say that I was a little disappointed with the result. I was excepting it to be great but the texture wasn&#39;t 100% right. The flavor however surpassed the store-bought puff pastry without a doubt.</description>
