      <description>A simple and flavorful appetizer. It takes 20 minutes total and it&#39;s the perfect starter for a special occasion. And now would be a good time to use good quality extra virgin olive oil, because it will make all the difference. I have been using this recipe for a while, that is the result of several recipes put together.Ingredients (4 servings) 1 loaf of day-old bread 1 medium size tomato 75g fresh mozzarella 1 garlic clove olive oil, vinegar, salt, basil, q.</description>

      <description>And now for another surprisingly good cookies that include olive oil in the recipe (like the Algarve&#39;s Honey Cake). The husband wanted to take some cookies with him to a competition and I usually bake lemon cookies and something else. These were a perfect addition. The recipe is from Pantagruel and it included an alcoholic Portuguese beverage called Aguardentewhich I didn&#39;t include because I don&#39;t like desserts with alcohol. But if you do, just add 9 tablespoons (or 1 cálice if you have any idea what I&#39;m talking about).</description>

      <description>I looked at this recipe several times before deciding that it might be a good one. The fact that it includes olive oil on the ingredients list threw me off at first, but my curiosity got the better of me and I am grateful for it. It was an exceptional good cake with a lot of flavor and a very soft texture. Yes, it asks for a lot of honey, but in the end it was just the right amount.</description>

      <description>It was time to share with you the recipe that gave name to this blog. We don&#39;t eat this as often as we should for something so tasty, because we don&#39;t have &#34;easy&#34; access to salted cod fish here in Denmark. It&#39;s sad but true. And this potatoes just ask for it. I actually get that feeling that there&#39;s something missing. But it&amp;rsquo;s better to eat them this way than to not eat them at all.</description>
