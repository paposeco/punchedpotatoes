      <description>So it has been a while! And here I am with probably the longest post so far. But for a very good reason: a new and improved puff pastry for tarts recipe (here is the old one) and some delicious apple tarts. The husband loves these tarts. We had some the last time we were in Portugal, which naturally prompted me to answer the question: can I make this at home?</description>

      <description>I talked raisins and nuts last week and it wouldn&#39;t be right to skip cooking something with apples this autumn. Whenever I&#39;m out of ideas for new recipes I just pick &#34;Pantagruel&#34; and look for inspiration. This recipe seemed simple enough and, more importantly, the main focus was on apples. The recipe called for Reinetteapples. These apples originated in France and are oftentimes used as a cooking apples in Portugal. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find them in Denmark and so I used Royal Gala instead.</description>
