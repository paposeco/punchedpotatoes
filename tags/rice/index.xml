      <description>I keep introducing Portuguese recipes as &#34;classic&#34;/&#34;traditional&#34;, but lets face it, Portuguese Rice Pudding is a Portuguese classic. It&#39;s on our tables at birthday parties, Christmas and any other occasion. This one is my mom&#39;s recipe and is a very simple recipe. Some people use vanilla or even some sort of flan to give it a more structured texture, but I prefer this version. It&#39;s creamy and delicious. I hope you enjoy it.</description>

      <description>This is a very simple meal but very tasty. I sometimes make the turkey steaks during the week with broccoli or some other vegetable, but because today is Saturday let&#39;s load up on carbs! No source for the recipe. It&#39;s just one of those things that I have eaten all my life. My mum actually makes this rice for special occasions because it&#39;s incredibly tasty.Ingredients (2 servings)Turkey Steaks</description>
