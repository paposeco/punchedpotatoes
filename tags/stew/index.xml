      <description>Today&#39;s recipe is a Portuguese classic, just like the Chicken Stew I shared before. It&#39;s from Pantagruel, and it takes about three hours to cook so it&#39;s probably a good weekend recipe. When adding the carrots andÂ shallots, you can also add potatoes, hence avoiding the need to cook a side dish. I didn&#39;t add the potatoes to the pot. Instead, I accompanied the beef stew with roasted potatoes (recipe to come).</description>

      <description>And now another recipe from Pantagruel. This was the first time that I tried this recipe, although I feel like I&#39;ve eaten this dish numerous times before. It reminds me of the chicken stew that used to be served at my university&#39;s dining hall. A better version of it for sure. When defining &#34;comfort food&#34; this dish should definitely be included. However, it takes a long time to cook so you should try it during the weekend.</description>
