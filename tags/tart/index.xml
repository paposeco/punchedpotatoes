      <description>Almond Tart is a staple at my grandparents for every party/celebration. The recipe that my aunts use is more of a cake than a tart. But I wanted to try something knew and as it turns out a tart base is just as good. This tart contains extraordinary amounts of butter and a crunchy top. It&amp;rsquo;s great on it&amp;rsquo;s own or even better when accompanied by some vanilla ice cream. The recipe is from Cozinha Tradicional Portuguesa.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s recipe is another Portuguese classic. It&#39;s my mum&#39;s recipe that my sister wrote down a few years ago (and good thing she did because my mother no longer has it). I have been wanting to try it for a long time, but I can&#39;t seem to find siam pumpkin jam in Denmark. So I brought a jar of jam with me from Portugal. This jam has a very distinctive savor and, although I wouldn&#39;t spread it on a slice of bread, when together with almonds and orange it has incredible flavor.</description>
