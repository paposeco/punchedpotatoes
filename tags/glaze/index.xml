      <description>And now for a very simple but delicious cake. The cake&#39;s recipe is from an aunt of mine and I decided to spruce it up a bit with an orange glaze. &#34;Pantagruel&#34; has several recipes for glazes, and orange+carrot seemed a great combo. It was.Â On a side note, can you tell that the light in Denmark has already started to change? From now until April I guess I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to start prepping dinner at 2pm if I want to shoot with natural light.</description>
