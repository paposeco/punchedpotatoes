      <description>I grew up eating pork carré occasionally and was truly surprised when I found this meat cut here in Denmark, even though carré doesn&#39;t sound Portuguese at all. And with a recognizable name! (Svine carré). I made some changes to a recipe from Culinária Portuguese and it worked perfectly. It is a moist pork roast and I think the fat on top helps to give it flavor. This recipe followed a series of mishaps in the last month, so I was more than happy with how wonderful this roast turned out.</description>

      <description>I cook this all the time. It&#39;s quick and easy. There are several variations of this recipe in Portugal depending on the region you come from. Where I&#39;m from we call it *Fritada*but, for instance, in the North of Portugal they call it *Rojões*. I served it with rice but a more traditional way would be to top it with chopped pickles and serve it with fries. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t seem to find the right kind of pickles here in Denmark (an assortment of cauliflower, carrots and cucumber).</description>

      <description>In kind of an homage to Denmark, I will share a recipe my favorite danish dish. You can find it in the prepared food section in the supermarkets all year long, but it&#39;s also a traditional Christmas dish. I used a Jamie Oliver recipe) which I think is pretty similar to the ones you can find here in Denmark.Ingredients (6 servings) 1,5kg (3.5 pounds) pork belly  2 onions 2 carrots 2 celery sticks 1 bulb of garlic salt, pepper, q.</description>

      <description>And now a recipe from Pantagruel. It&#39;s called &#34;Lombo de porco assado com mostarda&#34;. As per usual, there&amp;rsquo;s no mention of the oven temperature or cooking time. But it worked out great! The mustard complements the pork quite well. And here is a picture from Pantagruel of the pork cuts for the cook that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know them yet.
Ingredients (2-3 servings) 1 pork tenderloin (500g or 1lb) 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon vinegar salt, white wine q.</description>
