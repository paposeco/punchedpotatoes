      <description>The best away to celebrate our day off is to start the day with our favorite breakfast: Pancakes! We&#39;ve been eating pancakes on Saturdays ever since we moved to Denmark. It&#39;s easy to make and we never get tired of it. With some butter and maple syrup, a cup of coffee and orange juice... Saturdays are the best! Ingredients (2-3 servings) 1 egg 250mL milk (or 1 cup) 120g flour (1 cup) 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/3 teaspoon salt 2 heaped teaspoons baking powder  2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted butter  butter and maple syrup to taste  (Note: You can just use the same measuring instrument you used for the milk to measure the flour, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a measuring cup.</description>
