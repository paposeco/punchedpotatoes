      <description>An orange roll has very few ingredients and no flour at all. It might sound strange but this specific kind of roll doesn&#39;t need it. There are a lot of different kinds of rolls and it is a rather common dessert in Portugal. It is fresh and light. This is my mum&#39;s recipe which I think is better than the one from Pantagruel (the only difference is in the quantity used).</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s recipe comes from Pantagruel and this was the first time that I gave it a try. The fresh ginger got my attention, but I have to say that it doesn&#39;t sound, or taste, very Portuguese. Nonetheless, it was very tasty and the mixture of orange and ginger resulted in a remarkably fresh aroma, making this recipe perfect for a summer day.Ingredients (3 servings) 6 chicken thighs and/or whole legs 1dl white wine 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/2 tablespoon fresh grated ginger zest 1 orange fresh mint leaves salt q.</description>

      <description>I mentioned on a post about the chocolate mousse that I know three dessert recipes by heart. I&#39;ve shared the pancake recipe, the chocolate mousse and now it&#39;s time for the Sponge Cake. This time I decided to make an Orange Sponge Cake, but you can use the zest of a lemon instead of a zest of an orange.Â In my family, we make this cake regularly for guests or to take with us to my grandparents.</description>
