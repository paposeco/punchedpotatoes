      <description>In the spirit of this Christmas season, here is a recipe worthy of a Christmas dinner in Portugal. Bacalhau, or codfish that has been salted and dried, is commonly eaten on Christmas Eve in Portugal, roasted or boiled accompanied by cabbage or potatoes. My sister and my brother-in-law came to visit us recently and brought us two essential ingredients: bacalhau and broa (a special kind of cornbread). It&#39;s possible to find *bacalhau* in Denmark, but *broa* is nearly impossible, I&#39;d say.</description>
