      <description>Now for part II of the Portuguese Egg Tarts. As I mentioned before, I used store-bought puff pastry when I tried the egg tarts recipe for the first time. I promised a recipe for puff pastry and here it is. But I have to say that I was a little disappointed with the result. I was excepting it to be great but the texture wasn&#39;t 100% right. The flavor however surpassed the store-bought puff pastry without a doubt.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been wanting to try a Pastel de Nata recipe for years now. Pantagruel has two recipes, I tried them both and they were kind of bad... The taste was o.k. but the texture was nothing like the real deal. Who knows, maybe in the old days that&#39;s how they did it. Then I remembered that a aunt of mine used to bring a Portuguese egg tart (a whole tart) to my grandparents and thought that it might be worth a try.</description>
