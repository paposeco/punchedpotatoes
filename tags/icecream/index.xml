      <description>Today I&#39;ll share my favorite dessert as a kid. Perhaps it still is, but now I have to make it. Twenty years ago, my mum came up with the idea and it soon became a classic at my parent&#39;s restaurant (no longer in existence). It is, quite simply, frozen cream enveloped in frozen chocolate mousse, surrounded by melted chocolate. The outside chocolate remains soft, in contrast with the firmer interior, in a perfect blend of texture and sweetness.</description>
