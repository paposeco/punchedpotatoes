      <description>And now for another surprisingly good cookies that include olive oil in the recipe (like the Algarve&#39;s Honey Cake). The husband wanted to take some cookies with him to a competition and I usually bake lemon cookies and something else. These were a perfect addition. The recipe is from Pantagruel and it included an alcoholic Portuguese beverage called Aguardentewhich I didn&#39;t include because I don&#39;t like desserts with alcohol. But if you do, just add 9 tablespoons (or 1 cálice if you have any idea what I&#39;m talking about).</description>

      <description>I looked at this recipe several times before deciding that it might be a good one. The fact that it includes olive oil on the ingredients list threw me off at first, but my curiosity got the better of me and I am grateful for it. It was an exceptional good cake with a lot of flavor and a very soft texture. Yes, it asks for a lot of honey, but in the end it was just the right amount.</description>
