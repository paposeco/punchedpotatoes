      <description>There is nothing Eastery about this recipe, except for the fact that in Portugal people tend to have lamb or baby goat for Easter lunch. I don&#39;t think that it is as traditional as it is to have dried codfish for Christmas, for instance. But if you ask someone what they usually eat on Easter Sunday they would probably answer lamb. It&#39;s a simple recipe with and abundance of flavors and, as the majority of roasts, ideal for the weekend.</description>
