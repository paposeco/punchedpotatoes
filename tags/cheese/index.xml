      <description>I started using this recipe while I was still in college because it was so simple and also because it was a big crowd pleaser. The original recipe included fresh cheese but I have never tried it that way. I&#39;ve made so many changes to the recipe that I consider this my recipe for a no-bake cheesecake. You can use other kinds of jam. I know from experience that with mixed berry jam is just as good.</description>

      <description>I really wanted pizza the other day and since Pantagruel had a recipe for a milk pizza dough, it was the perfect opportunity to give it a try. And it was awesome. The crust was crispy and we picked a good mixture of toppings: mozzarella, feta cheese, olives, sweet pepper and onions. As for the sauce, I tried one from Pantagruel as well, but it was too sweet. I ended up using one from Jamie at Home.</description>
