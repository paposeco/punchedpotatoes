      <description>Every since I can remember, all birthdays in my family are celebrated with this cake. There is no real reason not to make it for other occasions, but I can&#39;t help but feel that it is a birthday type of cake. It also helps that my birthday is in July and that I get to use really good strawberries. It&#39;s my favorite cake without a doubt. If you don&#39;t like wet cakes, skip the part where I use the juice of one orange.</description>

      <description>I started using this recipe while I was still in college because it was so simple and also because it was a big crowd pleaser. The original recipe included fresh cheese but I have never tried it that way. I&#39;ve made so many changes to the recipe that I consider this my recipe for a no-bake cheesecake. You can use other kinds of jam. I know from experience that with mixed berry jam is just as good.</description>
