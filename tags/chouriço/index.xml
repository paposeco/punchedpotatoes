      <description>Chouriço Bread, or Pão com Chouriço as we call it, is a treat you can find in Portuguese markets and fairs. It&#39;s usually baked in a trailer with wood fired ovens. You can also find it year-round in supermarkets, cafes or, more specifically, in Lisbon at Merendeira. There are even places that serve not only chouriço bread, but dried codfish bread, black pudding bread and pork rind bread. Good stuff. The recipe for the bread dough can also be used for baking regular bread.</description>
