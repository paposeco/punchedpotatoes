      <description>Valentine&#39;s Day is almost here and I just had to make something in the shape of an heart. Last year was breakfast, but this year I made cinnamon cookies. Last Christmas I got a classic Portuguese cookbook called &amp;ldquo;Cozinha Tradicional Portuguesa&amp;rdquo; by Maria de Lourdes Modesto. It has amazing detailed recipes from all over the country and it even has some pictures (as opposed to Pantagruel). This is the third recipe that I&amp;rsquo;ve tried from this book and it turned out even better than I was expecting.</description>

      <description>I keep introducing Portuguese recipes as &#34;classic&#34;/&#34;traditional&#34;, but lets face it, Portuguese Rice Pudding is a Portuguese classic. It&#39;s on our tables at birthday parties, Christmas and any other occasion. This one is my mom&#39;s recipe and is a very simple recipe. Some people use vanilla or even some sort of flan to give it a more structured texture, but I prefer this version. It&#39;s creamy and delicious. I hope you enjoy it.</description>

      <title>Honey &amp; Cinnamon Cookies</title>

      <description>And now for another surprisingly good cookies that include olive oil in the recipe (like the Algarve&#39;s Honey Cake). The husband wanted to take some cookies with him to a competition and I usually bake lemon cookies and something else. These were a perfect addition. The recipe is from Pantagruel and it included an alcoholic Portuguese beverage called Aguardentewhich I didn&#39;t include because I don&#39;t like desserts with alcohol. But if you do, just add 9 tablespoons (or 1 cálice if you have any idea what I&#39;m talking about).</description>

      <title>Cinnamon Rolls</title>

      <description>The first time I visited Denmark, I tried their Cinnamon Rolls from some bakery and I have to say that I wasn&#39;t impressed. I also tried the store bought ones and although I liked them better, I got the feeling that I hadn&#39;t tried the real deal yet. So, when I saw that Aarstiderne had released their recipe on their Facebook page I couldn&#39;t resist giving it a try (Aarstiderne supplies organically produced fruit and vegetables door to door).</description>
