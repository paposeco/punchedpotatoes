      <description>I&#39;ve shared a recipe for bacalhau (salted and dried codfish), but no Portuguese Christmas dinner is complete without filhoses (or velhoses). Or at least this is true for Center Portugal. Filhoses can be made of pumpkin or of carrots. In my family however we only make carrot filhoses. Both my grandmothers use carrots and this is the recipe of one of them. They never really measured their ingredients, but this is a close approximation that an aunt of mine came up with, after watching my grandmother.</description>

      <description>In the spirit of this Christmas season, here is a recipe worthy of a Christmas dinner in Portugal. Bacalhau, or codfish that has been salted and dried, is commonly eaten on Christmas Eve in Portugal, roasted or boiled accompanied by cabbage or potatoes. My sister and my brother-in-law came to visit us recently and brought us two essential ingredients: bacalhau and broa (a special kind of cornbread). It&#39;s possible to find *bacalhau* in Denmark, but *broa* is nearly impossible, I&#39;d say.</description>
