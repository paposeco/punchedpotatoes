      <description>I really wanted pizza the other day and since Pantagruel had a recipe for a milk pizza dough, it was the perfect opportunity to give it a try. And it was awesome. The crust was crispy and we picked a good mixture of toppings: mozzarella, feta cheese, olives, sweet pepper and onions. As for the sauce, I tried one from Pantagruel as well, but it was too sweet. I ended up using one from Jamie at Home.</description>
