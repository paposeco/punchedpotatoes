      <description>This recipe resulted in a flavorful braised beef. It&#39;s quite simple to make although it takes nearly 2 hours to cook. The recipe is from &#34;Culinária Portuguesa&#34;. As for the garlic and parsley butter, it&#39;s a family recipe and it&#39;s incredibly good. In potatoes, on top of a steak, it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s just good.Ingredients (6 servings)For the Braised Beef:
 1kg stewing beef  2 medium onions 2 red peppers  3 tomatoes  2 garlic cloves 1 bay leaf bunch fresh parsley 3dl (1 1/4 cups) white wine 1 tablespoon vinegar 1dl (1/3 cup) olive oil bacon, salt, pepper q.</description>
